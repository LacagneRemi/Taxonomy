Taxonomy exercise
====

In this solution, you can find the Taxonomy project and its test project with these 3 following endpoints that will serve basic operations :

0. Add a new node to the tree.
1. Get all child nodes of a given node from the tree. (Just 1 layer of children)
2. Change the parent node of a given node.

Each class have the following data:

0. Node identifier.
1. node name.
2. who is the parent node.
3. The height of the node. (in the example above `height(root)=0` and `height(a)=1`)
4. Managers should have an extra field specifying the name of the department they are managing.
5. Developers should have an extra field specifying the name of the programming language they are strongest in.

You will find more precisions about documentation for each method in the solution
